# Usage

1. To develop your own user script with Solidjs, you first need to clone the project.

```
gh repo clone Ferhatduran55/solidjs-userscript --branch typescript
```

2. Then download the requirements:
   using `bun`

```
bun install
```

3. After the download is completed, you can adjust the userscript object in `package.json` as you wish by using the [setup guide](https://github.com/va4ok/userscript-builder?tab=readme-ov-file#setup). You can adjust the user script's metadata using the child meta object, where some adjustments come by default and you don't need to type them.

```json package.json
{
  "userscript": {
    "entry": "./dist/index.js",     // Entry file
    "dev": "./dist",               // Output folder for dev builds
    "release": "./release",        // Output folder for release builds
    "fileName": "filename",        // Output filename -> filename.user.js
    "meta": {                      // Userscript meta info
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}

```

4. After setting, we build the user script using the commands defined in `package.json` can use [command guide](https://github.com/va4ok/userscript-builder?tab=readme-ov-file#setup)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc && vite build --minify=false && userscript-builder --mode dev",
    "build": "tsc && vite build && userscript-builder --mode dev",
    "release:patch": "tsc && vite build && userscript-builder --mode bugfix",
    "release:minor": "tsc && vite build && userscript-builder --mode minor",
    "release:major": "tsc && vite build && userscript-builder --mode major"
  }
}
```

5.After it is build, user script will be created in the `dist` folder by default.

```
bun run build
```

If it is release, user script will be created in the `release` folder by default.

```
bun run release:bugfix
```

These names are userscript.entry, userscript.dev, userscript.release and userscript.fileName values comes from in `package.json`.

`userscript.entry`: First of all, the Solidjs project is built with vite and this file is saved in the dist folder, this value is the name of the saved file and the user script is created using this file.

`userscript.dev`: The location where the user script will be saved when it is built.

`userscript.release`: The location where the user script will be saved when release.

`userscript.fileName`: The new filename that the user script will receive when it is saved to its defined location, for example `[name].user.js`.

You can find the files by following the â€œindex.tsx" code under src.
